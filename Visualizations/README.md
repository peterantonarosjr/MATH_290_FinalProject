# Visualizations

In this folder are visualizations of our tables. These visualizations assist in our analysis and story telling of our data.

## [Table Profiles](https://github.com/peterantonarosjr/MATH_290_FinalProject/blob/main/Visualizations/Table%20Profiles.zip)

This zipped folder contains three files,

- Free_Reduced_priced_Meals_Profile.html
- SAT_Scores_Profile.html
- Schools.html

These are files that can open in your browser. These profiles were constructed with the [Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling) library.
